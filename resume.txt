## Overview

I am an experienced professional web developer with a passion for quality software. I enjoy engaging with clients & users to deliver innovative, usable solutions. I'm skilled in both server-side and front-end technologies and experienced with agile practices such as test-driven and behaviour-driven development, pair programming & continuous integration.

I am constantly learning and extending my skills. I contribute to open-source projects, blog about software development and have spoken at several conferences internationally. In my free time I cycle, read and enjoy music.

## Skills

I have been writing code since my teenage years. For the last few years mostly using Groovy, Grails and JavaScript technologies including Coffeescript, but I have many years of experience with Java and some facility with Ruby, XSLT, C++ and even COBOL.

I know my way around Mac OS and Unix and have done support and administration work as part of cross-skilled teams.

## Education

Computer Science, B.S.
Fall 2006 - Spring 2011
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

## Proficiency

I have been writing code, running servers and experimenting with new software since 2002. Most recently the majority of code I have written has been in Java, Ruby, Javascript and Bash, but I have experience in C, Python, SML/NJ, C++, SQL and F#.
