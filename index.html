<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I am an experienced professional web developer with a passion for quality software. I enjoy engaging with clients &amp; users to deliver innovative, usable solutions. I'm skilled in both server-side and front-end technologies and experienced with agile practices such as test-driven and behaviour-driven development, pair programming &amp; continuous integration.</p>

<p>I am constantly learning and extending my skills. I contribute to open-source projects, blog about software development and have spoken at several conferences internationally. In my free time I cycle, read, mix cocktails and enjoy music.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>I have been writing code since my teenage years. For the last few years mostly using Groovy, Grails and JavaScript technologies including Coffeescript, but I have many years of experience with Java and some facility with Ruby, XSLT, C++ and even COBOL.</p>

<p>I know my way around Mac OS and Unix and have done support and administration work as part of cross-skilled teams.</p>
